## Routes File Overview

This documentation provides an overview of the routes file, which serves as a crucial reference point for understanding the routing structure of the project. To navigate this documentation effectively, begin by exploring the routes file.

## Routing Simplified

In this project, the routing mechanism follows a straightforward pattern. The second portion of the URL represents the Controller name, while the third portion denotes the method name.

For example, if the URL is `{{Base_url}}/user/create`, the corresponding routing is as follows:

- **Controller:** UserController
- **Method:** create

This simplicity in routing enhances readability and aids developers in quickly grasping the structure of the project's endpoints.

Feel free to refer to the routes file for a comprehensive overview of all routes and their corresponding controllers and methods.
